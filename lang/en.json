    "privacy.s3.content": "<p><strong>Relevant legal bases according to the GDPR:</strong> Below you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations in your or our country of residence or domicile may apply.</p><ul class=\"list-disc pl-5\"><li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li><li><strong>Performance of a contract and prior to entering into a contract (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</li><li><strong>Legal obligation (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.</li><li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.</li></ul><br><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany: </strong>In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. This includes in particular the Act on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act – BDSG). The BDSG contains special regulations on the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and for transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases including profiling. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.<br><br><strong>Note on the applicability of GDPR and Swiss DPA: </strong> These data protection notices serve to provide information under both the Swiss DPA and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, please note that due to the broader geographical application and comprehensibility, the terms of the GDPR are used. In particular, instead of the terms “processing” of “personal data”, “overriding interest” and “particularly sensitive personal data” used in the Swiss DPA, the terms “processing” of “personal data”, “legitimate interest” and “special categories of data” used in the GDPR are used. However, the legal meaning of the terms will continue to be determined by the Swiss DPA within the scope of its application.",

    "privacy.s4.content": "We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs, and the nature, scope, circumstances, and purposes of processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.<br><br>These measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data, as well as access, input, disclosure, availability, and separation of the data. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure that data subjects' rights are exercised, data is deleted, and we respond to data threats.",
    "privacy.s5.title": "Transmission of Personal Data",
    "privacy.s5.content": "In the course of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transmitted or disclosed to other bodies, companies, legally independent organizational units, or persons. The recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we comply with the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude corresponding contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data that serve to protect your data.",

    "privacy.s6.content": "Data processing in third countries: If we transfer data to a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if this occurs in the context of using third-party services or disclosing or transferring data to other persons, bodies, or companies, this will only be done in accordance with legal requirements.<br><br>For data transfers to the USA, we primarily rely on the Data Privacy Framework (DPF), which was recognized as a secure legal framework by an adequacy decision of the EU Commission on July 10, 2023. Additionally, we have concluded Standard Contractual Clauses with the respective providers, which comply with the requirements of the EU Commission and establish contractual obligations to protect your data.<br><br>This dual protection ensures comprehensive security for your data: The DPF forms the primary level of protection, while the Standard Contractual Clauses serve as additional security. Should changes occur within the DPF framework, the Standard Contractual Clauses will act as a reliable fallback option. This way, we ensure that your data remains adequately protected even in the event of any political or legal changes.<br><br>We will inform you for each individual service provider whether they are certified under the DPF and whether Standard Contractual Clauses are in place. Further information on the DPF and a list of certified companies can be found on the website of the U.S. Department of Commerce at [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).<br><br>For data transfers to other third countries, corresponding security measures apply, in particular Standard Contractual Clauses, explicit consent, or legally required transfers.
